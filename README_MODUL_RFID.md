You **still have the error** because the `react-native-zebra-rfid-barcode` library is referencing the `.aar` file using a **relative path** that does not exist or is not correct for your project structure.

Your app module is correctly referencing:

```groovy
implementation files('libs/API3_LIB-release-2.0.2.114.aar')
```

and the file is (should be) at:

```
D:\Repo\TRIAL\AwesomeProjectRFID\android\app\libs\API3_LIB-release-2.0.2.114.aar
```

But the library module is referencing:

```groovy
compileOnly files('../../../../android/app/libs/API3_LIB-release-2.0.2.114.aar')
```

or similar, and **if this path is wrong or the file is missing, you will get the error**.

---

## How to Fix (Step-by-step)

1. **Ensure the `.aar` file exists at the correct path:**

   ```
   D:\Repo\TRIAL\AwesomeProjectRFID\android\app\libs\API3_LIB-release-2.0.2.114.aar
   ```

2. **In the library's build.gradle (build.gradle):**

   Make sure you use the correct relative path for `compileOnly`:

   ```groovy
   // filepath: d:\Repo\TRIAL\AwesomeProjectRFID\node_modules\react-native-zebra-rfid-barcode\android\build.gradle
   dependencies {
       // ...existing dependencies...
       compileOnly files('../../../../android/app/libs/API3_LIB-release-2.0.2.114.aar')
   }
   ```

   > **If you are not sure about the relative path, try using the absolute path for testing:**

   ```groovy
   compileOnly files('D:/Repo/TRIAL/AwesomeProjectRFID/android/app/libs/API3_LIB-release-2.0.2.114.aar')
   ```

   (Use forward slashes `/` or double backslashes AwesomeProjectRFID.)

3. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```sh
   cd android
   gradlew clean
   gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

---

## **Summary**

- The error means the file is not found at the path referenced by the library.
- Double-check the path in both your app and the library.
- Use an absolute path in `compileOnly` for testing if needed.
- Clean and rebuild after changes.

---

**If you still get the error, please post the exact `dependencies` block from your build.gradle and confirm the full path to your `.aar` file.**
